_You are currently in the main section (Master branch) of this repository. Use other branches to navigate._

Welcome to the Arduino repository for beginners. Arduino is an open source prototyping platform where you can design different project to solve your problems. This is kinda for my personal documentation for the future and also a beginners guide. While creating this repo I am currently learning Arduino and Circuit Design. I found there are no organized place for learning Arduino. So, as I am learning I will be documenting this with what I have learnt from a beginner's perspective.

Also, it will be updated in the future.

Happy learning!
